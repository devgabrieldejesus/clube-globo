## What is the Clube Globo?

Clube Globo is a club for Globo users to have the best experience, in a personalized way. The platform gathers all Globo content in a kind of menu, and has several interactions that accumulate points (GPontos) that can become prizes! When registering, the user indicates his / her tastes and preferences, and the system already personalizes the profile the user's way. And with a difference: it will have access to all content in one place, without having to migrate to other applications and sites to have access.
